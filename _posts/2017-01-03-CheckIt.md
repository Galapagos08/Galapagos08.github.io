CheckIt is a checklist application I created for my daughter to use to keep help her get ready for school in the mornings. I wanted to create an app that was easy to use and that allows users to create and edit multiple checklists. I also added a grocery list template that allows a user to choose common grocery items to add to a new checklist. Future functionality will include additional template lists similar to the grocery list.
