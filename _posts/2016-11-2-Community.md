Community is an invite-only social networking application deisgned for community organizations such as churches, civic organizations, and local job-networking groups. It was developed in collaboration with two back-end developers. The Java back-end is a set of web services that connect a relational postgres database to the iOS client. The iOS client was written in Swift 3.0.
