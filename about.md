I'm Dan, a former attorney who left a successful legal career to become an iOS developer and bridge my creative and analytical skills with my love of technology. I want to find innovative ways to use technology to provide meaningful change. I am insatiably curious, and I love learning new things.

I live in Atlanta with my wife, daughter, and two rescue dogs. When I am not coding, I enjoy camping, travel, and time with a good book.
